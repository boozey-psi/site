*Agentic systems leverage multiple agents and multiple tools. These agents and tools can be developed and hosted by different providers. To allow inter-agent communication and to access different data sources, standards like Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) are evolving.*

[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) is an evolving standard driven by Anthropic which focusses on the re-use of tools and access to various data sources. [Agent Communication Protocol](https://docs.beeai.dev/acp/alpha/introduction) (ACP) is led by IBM Research and goes one step further by proposing how to do agent-to-agent collaboration.

# Model Context Protocol

MCP defines a common protocol to access tools. Custom tools can be developed, for example to access enterprise data and to invoke business logic. Additionally, tools can be re-used via [MCP servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers?tab=readme-ov-file#-reference-servers). The MCP standards provides the flexibility to switch between LLM providers and vendors.

> MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

MCP offers a specification as well as [SDKs](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk) to enable developers to implement MCP in their systems.

Enterprise features like authentication and remote MCP server support are planned to be added soon.

# MCP Example

Here is a simple [example](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server) of an MCP server. Python functions can be marked as tools by using decorators. The descriptions and arguments are described via natural language.

```python
from typing import Any
import httpx
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("weather")
NWS_API_BASE = "https://api.weather.gov"
USER_AGENT = "weather-app/1.0"

async def make_nws_request(url: str) -> dict[str, Any] | None:
    """Make a request to the NWS API with proper error handling."""
    headers = {
        "User-Agent": USER_AGENT,
        "Accept": "application/geo+json"
    }
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        try:
            response = await client.get(url, headers=headers, timeout=30.0)
            response.raise_for_status()
            return response.json()
        except Exception:
            return None

@mcp.tool()
async def get_forecast(latitude: float, longitude: float) -> str:
    """Get weather forecast for a location.

    Args:
        latitude: Latitude of the location
        longitude: Longitude of the location
    """
    points_url = f"{NWS_API_BASE}/points/{latitude},{longitude}"
    points_data = await make_nws_request(points_url)
    if not points_data:
        return "Unable to fetch forecast data for this location."

    forecast_url = points_data["properties"]["forecast"]
    forecast_data = await make_nws_request(forecast_url)
    if not forecast_data:
        return "Unable to fetch detailed forecast."

    periods = forecast_data["properties"]["periods"]
    forecasts = []
    for period in periods[:5]:
        forecast = f"""
{period['name']}:
Temperature: {period['temperature']}Â°{period['temperatureUnit']}
Wind: {period['windSpeed']} {period['windDirection']}
Forecast: {period['detailedForecast']}
"""
        forecasts.append(forecast)
    return "\n---\n".join(forecasts)
```

# Agent Communication Protocol

ACP goes one step further and proposes how to do agent-to-agent collaboration.

> The Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) is a protocol designed to standardize how agents communicate, enabling automation, agent-to-agent collaboration, UI integration, and developer tooling. Current agent systems often use diverse communication standards, causing complexity, integration difficulties, and vendor lock-in. ACP addresses these issues uniquely by standardizing interactions tailored specifically for agents.

ACP is being defined by the [BeeAI](https://github.com/i-am-bee) community which is driven by IBM Research. BeeAI is govererned by the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/). Right now ACP is in alpha and the organizers are inviting the community to actively participate.

Topics are listed on the [ACP Architecture](https://docs.beeai.dev/acp/alpha/architecture) page: 

* Support for Stateful Agents
* Choosing between REST and JSON-RPC for Communication
* WebSockets vs HTTP vs Peer-to-Peer (Full Duplex Communication)
* Streaming Data between Agents
* Handling Request Cancellation and Ensuring Persistency
* Agent and Tool Providers versus MCP Servers: Roles and Responsibilities
* Configuration and Model Dependency Management for Agents
